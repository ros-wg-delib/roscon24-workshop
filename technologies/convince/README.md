# AS2FM by CONVINCE

This is an introduction to the tool [AS2FM (Autonomous Systems to Formal Models)](https://convince-project.github.io/AS2FM/index.html) that is part of the [CONVINCE toolchain](https://convince-project.github.io/overview/).
While there is also a [full documentation](https://convince-project.github.io/AS2FM/index.html), this is a short introductory example.

## Introduction to example

The folder `technologies/convince/example_w_bt` contains a model of a simplistic system that consist of a battery that is drained at a fixed rate and the logic to charge it when it is low.

In the folder you will find the following files:

- `main.xml` - The main file referencing the other files and defining some global system parameters.
- __`battery_drainer.scxml`__ - The state machine that models the battery which is drained.
- __`battery_manager.scxml`__ - Model of the manager that will evaluate the battery level.
- __`bt.xml`__ - The behavior tree that implements the charging logic.
- __`bt_topic_action.scxml`__ - The model of the action plugin that allows the behavior tree to trigger ROS actions.
- __`bt_topic_condition.scxml`__ - The model of the condition plugin that allows the behavior tree to check ROS topics.
- __`battery_properties.jani`__ - The file defining the properties to be checked by the model checker:
  - `battery_depleted` - The battery is eventually depleted.
  - `battery_below_20` - The battery is eventually below 20%.
  - `battery_alarm_on` - The alarm is eventually on.
  - `battery_charged` - The battery will always eventually be at 100% again.

## Prerequisites

This example expects btlib to be built.
This should normally be the case in the docker image. If not, run this:

```bash
cd $ROS_WS
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select btlib
source ./install/setup.bash
```

## Running the example

To run the example, navigate to the `example_w_bt` folder:

```bash
cd $ROS_WS/src/technologies/convince/example_w_bt
```

First, you need to translate all of the files mentioned above into a single JANI model file:

```bash
scxml_to_jani main.xml
```

Note that there is now additionally a file `main.jani` in the folder.

Then, you can run the model checker on the generated JANI file, specifying the property to check:

```bash
smc_storm --model main.jani --properties-names battery_charged
```

## Expected output

This will check the property `battery_charged` and output the result of the model checking which should look something like this:

```bash
CONVINCE Statistical Model Checker
Checking model: main.jani
Property "battery_charged": Pmin=? [true Usteps>=100 ((topic_level_msg.data = 100) & topic_level_msg.valid)];
Result: 1
```
