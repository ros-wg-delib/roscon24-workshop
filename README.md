# Hands-On with ROS 2 Deliberation Technologies

> [!WARNING]
> WORK IN PROGRESS!

This repository contains materials for the ROSCon 2024 workshop on ROS 2
Deliberation Technologies.

## Setup

First, clone this repository and its submodules.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ros-wg-delib/roscon24-workshop.git
```

Then, build the Docker image.

```bash
docker compose build
```

Start a container.

```bash
docker compose run base
```

Once you're in the container, check that you can run a demo.

```bash
ros2 run delib_ws_p1 run
```

**NOTE:** If you want to cleanup the colcon build artifacts across container usage,
you can run this command (it will ask you for your sudo password):

```bash
./clean_build.sh
```
